# fatemabhayani.github.io

Personal site for **Fatema Bhayani** — AI-driven educator & researcher. Built with Jekyll + custom CSS, designed for light mode and fast load.

## Deploy (3 steps)

1. **Create repo** named exactly `fatemabhayani.github.io` under your GitHub account.
2. Upload these files (or drag-drop the zip). Commit to the **main** branch.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**. It should automatically publish from `main` (root). Wait ~1–2 minutes, then visit `https://fatemabhayani.github.io`.

### Edit content

- Home content lives in `index.md` (sections: Research, About, Teaching, Awards, Blog, Contact).
- Blog posts live in `_posts/` using standard Jekyll Markdown naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.
- Styles: edit `assets/css/style.css`.
- Email obfuscation lives in `assets/js/main.js` (function `revealEmail`).

### Notes

- No headshot is used (by design).
- “Selected Work & Writing” is intentionally **omitted** for now — enable later if desired.
- Replace `assets/img/og-card.png` with your own share image (1200x630), or keep the placeholder.
